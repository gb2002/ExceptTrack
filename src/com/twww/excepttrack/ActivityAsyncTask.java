 *
 * Android's ASyncTask is very useful, but using a background thread
 * can be though in the context of the Activity lifecycle, at least
 * if you'd prefer your background task to not restart with an
 * orientation change.
 *
 * This version of ASyncTask tries to alleviate those pains. The idea
 * is that you "retain" an instance of this task on orientation change.
 * The task can be "connected" to exactly one or zero objects at any
 * time. On orientation change, the old instance disconnects itself,
 * then the new one connects.
 *
 * The object you connect to typically is something that references
 * back to your activity (might be the activity itself), and which your
 * task needs to do it's job (for example, where it posts it's results
 * to).
 *
 * This class ensures that whenever a new object connects while the task
 * is still active, the preExecute() handler is run again, and if the
 * task finished while no object was connected, the processPostExecute()
 * handler is run the next time an activity connects.
 *
 * Note "processPostExecute()", which is a replacement for the
 * "postExcute()" method of ASyncTask which you should use instead.
 *
 * TODO: there is a small chance at race conditions here when checking
 * for mWrapped and setting mPostProcessingDone. We should fix those
 * by using a lock.
